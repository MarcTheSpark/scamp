SCAMP EXAMPLE: Spanners

Demonstration of starting and stopping various spanners, such as slurs, hairpins, trills, brackets, and pedal lines.
Note that there is some finickiness with both lilypond and MusicXML output. LilyPond does not allow multiple of the
same spanner at the same time (at least in the same voice), whereas MusicXML does. If exporting to MusicXML, you can
keep the spanners straight by providing a label.

On the other hand, implementations of MusicXML in many notation programs mangle spanner input. So there's that.
