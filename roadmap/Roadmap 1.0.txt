Documentation:
    - Point to the example scripts in the documentation
    - Point to the Forum in the tutorial
    - Music made with SCAMP in the documentation!
    - Add last tutorial video to tutorial videos page
    - Make a documentation page for note properties, including tables of all the possible options.
    - Add documentation for installing nicer soundfont
    - Maybe make a multi-tempo example that doesn't have nested tempi first.

Testing:
    - Look into unittests

Playback:
    - Make SCUtils receive start values for arbitrary parameters as well, and send those at note creation,
    not just afterwards. Then alter play_note to put the expected duration in properties.temp, add that to the
    note info dict, and have that get sent in the osc message as an extra parameter from the very beginning.
    - Also, alter ScampUtils so that the SynthDef doesn't need to have pitch, volume, or gate and just ignores it
    if it doesn't.
    - Can we put chords on the same clock??
    - Have pitch and volume playback adjustments affect start_notes?
    - Add a soundfile playback implementation

Engraving:
    - Clean up quantization: allow setting exact divisors. Remove max indigestibility in favor of setting exact divisors.
    - Engraving lines!
    - Fixing the wanderer class tempo stuff
    - Fix problem where it splits into two voices when you have notes that overlapped originally but then quantize
    in such a way that they would fit into the same voice. e.g. 0 to 0.7, 0.65 - 1.0, quantized into a triplet.
    - Two eighth note rests in a triplet shouldn't combine
    - Key signatures?
    - abjad: maybe try to implement outside-staff-priority on any situation with multiple attached notations, articulation,
    texts, etc. so that the first one attached comes closest in the score.
    - MusicXML <part-abbreviation> tag
    - MusicXML "accidental" tag

Assorted:
    - Clean up dependency tree so that it's not such a goddamn nigntmare
    - Make it so that text output can be controlled better

Extensions:
    - MIDI file to Performance
