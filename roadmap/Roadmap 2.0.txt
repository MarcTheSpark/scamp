Quantization:
    - Incorporate Paul Nauert's Q-Grid quantization ideas.

Playback:
    - Switch to LinuxSampler as default, enabling use of .sfz files
    - Key-switches that allow the nature of the playback of a single instrument to change. This would be done via the
    properties dictionary, I think, maybe also affecting notation?

Engraving:
    - Engraving Dynamics, both at the note level and the phrase level. Perhaps do this by allowing the user to define
    dynamics notations along with their effect on playback. These would then affect both playback and notation. An
    other possibility might be to define DynamicEnvelope("fp<f") objects, in which a string is parsed into both a volume
    envelope and a notation.
    - Engraving slurs?
    - Should it be possible to signal notations that are not written as notes. E.g. a key-switch maybe should be a
    notation that affects from then on? Or a clef change -- how do we do that?
    - Engraving nested tuplets, representing them in the Score object.

Pymusicxml:
    - Make nested tuplets possible

Clockblocks:
    - Add "run_with_latency" to clocks, maybe using a pyaudio callback? Use this to play notes.

Other:
    - Possible integration with IPython notebook? Maybe start with expenvelope?
