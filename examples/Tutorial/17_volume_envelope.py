SCAMP Example: Volume Envelope

Plots an envelope representing a forte-piano-crescendo dynamic, and then uses it to affect the dynamics of a note's
playback. This example shows that an Envelope can be passed to the volume argument of "play_note", just like it can
to the pitch argument. (The list short-hand also works, by the way.)
