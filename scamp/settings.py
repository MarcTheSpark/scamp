Module containing the main settings classes: :class:`PlaybackSettings`, :class:`QuantizationSettings`, and
:class:`EngravingSettings`, as well as :class:`TempoSettings` and :class:`GlissandiSettings`, which are part of
:class:`EngravingSettings`. A module-level instance for each (:code:`playback_settings`, :code:`quantization_settings`,

scamp package. These instances are part of the global scamp namespace, and contain scamp's default configuration.

        envelopes are resized to the length of the note. The default value of "lists" does this resizing only when the

    """
    Namespace containing the settings relevant to the engraving of scores.

    :param settings_dict: dictionary from which to set all settings attributes
    :ivar allow_duple_tuplets_in_compound_time: There are two ways to express a division of a beat in compound time in
        two: with a duple tuplet or with dotted notes. For instance, half of a beat in 3/8 can be represented as a
        dotted-eighth or an eighth inside of a 2:3 tuplet. If this is set to True, we allow the latter option.
    :ivar max_voices_per_part: integer specifying how many voices we allow in a single staff before creating extra
        staves to accommodate them.
    :ivar max_dots_allowed: integer specifying how many dots we allow a note to have before it's just too many dots.
    :ivar beat_hierarchy_spacing: Should be >= 1. Larger numbers treat the various nested levels of beat subdivision as
        further apart, leading to a greater tendency to show the beat structure rather than combine tie notes into
        fewer pieces.
    :ivar num_divisions_penalty: Ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 treats having multiple tied notes to represent a single
        note event as just as good as having fewer notes, while numbers closer to 1 increasingly favor using fewer
        notes in a tied group.
    :ivar rest_beat_hierarchy_spacing: Same as beat_hierarchy_spacing, but for rests. (We generally want rests to be
        more likely to split.)
    :ivar rest_num_divisions_penalty: Same as num_divisions_penalty, but for rests. (We generally want rests to be less
        inclined to recombine.)
    :ivar articulation_split_protocols: Dictionary mapping articulation names to either "first", "last", "both" or
        "all". When a note has been given a particular articulation during playback, but needs to be engraved as a group
        of tied notes, the question arises: which of those tied pieces should get the articulation? For instance, an
        accent probably wants to be on the first note, since it's an attack, and a staccato dot probably should be on
        the last note, since it's about release. The value "both" will place the articulation on both the first and last
        note, and "all" will place the articulation on every note of the tied group.
    :ivar clefs_by_instrument: Dictionary mapping instrument names to a list of clefs used by those instruments. Instead
        of simply the clef name, a tuple of (clef name, redefined_pitch_center) can be given. This overrides the pitch
        center given in clef_pitch_centers for that clef on that instrument, since clef choice can be idiosyncratic to
        the given instrument. The "DEFAULT" entry is used for instruments not explicitly specified.
    :ivar clef_pitch_centers: Pitch center used when deciding on clef choice. Default is to use the pitch of the center
        line. The clef chosen will be the one whose pitch center is closest to the average pitch.
    :ivar clef_selection_policy: Either "measure-wise", in which case clef can be changed measure by measure if needed,
        or "part-wise", in which case a single clef choice is used for the entire part..
    :ivar default_titles: Title or list of titles from which to choose for a score that has been created without
        specifying a title.
    :ivar default_composers: Name or list of name from which to choose for a score that has been created without
        specifying a composer.
    :ivar default_spelling_policy: the SpellingPolicy to use by default in determining accidentals.
    :ivar ignore_empty_parts: if True, don't bother to include parts in a score if there's nothing in them.
    :ivar glissandi: instance of :class:`GlissandiSettings` specifying how glissandi should be engraved.
    :ivar tempo: instance of :class:`TempoSettings` specifying how tempo changes should be engraved.
    :ivar pad_incomplete_parts: If true, add measures to parts that don't have enough music in them so that they are
        go the full length of the score.
    :ivar show_music_xml_command_line: Terminal command to run when opening up MusicXML scores. It is easiest to set
        this by calling set_music_xml_application. The value "auto" tries to find an appropriate application
        automatically.
    :ivar show_microtonal_annotations: if True, annotates microtonal pitches with the exact floating-point MIDI pitch
        value that they are intended to represent. (This is useful, since normally the best a notation program can
        do is quarter tones.
    :ivar microtonal_annotation_digits: number of digits after the decimal place to show when showing microtonal
        annotations.
