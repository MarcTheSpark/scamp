Module containing the :class:`PerformanceNote`, :class:`PerformancePart`, and :class:`Performance` classes, which
represent transcriptions of notes played by a group of :class:`~scamp.instruments.ScampInstrument` objects. These
classes contain continuous time, pitch, volume, and other parameter data, which can then be quantized and converted
into the notation-based classes in the score module.

            paper here: https://mat.ucsb.edu/Publications/Quantification_of_Harmony_and_Metre.pdf. By setting a max
            indigestibility, we can allow larger divisions of the beat, but only so long as they are easy ones. For
            instance, a max_divisor of 16 and a max_divisor_indigestibility of 8 would allow the beat to be divided
