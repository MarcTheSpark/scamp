        Returns the indigestibilities for a given set of divisors of a given length, taking into account how those
        lengths would most naturally divide.

        If we write a length as a fraction in simplest terms, its numerator is its most natural division. For instance,
        a beat of length 1.5 would be written as a fraction as 3/2, and 3 is the most natural divisor. To get the
        indigestibility we consider the indigestibility that results when we divide a given divisor by that numerator
        and pull out any common factors.

        Example: if length = 1.5, then length_fraction = 3/2. So for a divisor of 6, the relative division is 6/3,
        which Fraction automatically reduces to 2/1. On the other hand, a divisor of 2 has relative division 2/3,
        which is irreducible thus the div_indigestibility for divisor 6 in this case is indigestibility(2) = 1
        and the div_indigestibility for divisor 2 is indigestibility(2) + indigestibility(3) = 3.6667. This is
        appropriate for a beat of length 1.5 (compound meter).

        Note that there's a little issue here with the divisor of 3, since 3/3 = 1, which has indigestibility 0
        Ultimately this would lead to that divisor being chosen no matter what, which is not good. To avoid this
        eventuality, when the length fraction numerator is not 1, we add one to all of the divisor indigestibilities
        to avoid zeroing things out.
