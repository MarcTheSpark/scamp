Kadenze Course
==============

If you're new to Python, or making music in Python, a great place to get started is with my
`Kadenze Course <https://www.kadenze.com/courses/computer-assisted-music-in-python-i/info?utm_campaign=course_syllabus_share&utm_content=course_id%3D317&utm_medium=share&utm_source=kadenze>`_. Not only is it a great,
beginner-friendly introduction to Python and SCAMP, but the registration fee also helps support the work that I do!
